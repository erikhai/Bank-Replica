# ATM-Replica

## What is this project about?
This entire project reflects the interactions people can have in a bank. Here, you can either login as an admin or a customer or create a new account with us. 
As a customer, you can view and update your details, make deposits and withdrawals, remove your account, and make transfers of funds. As an admin, you can perfom similar actions but you can update the details of anyones account and you can delete anyones account.
There are 2 accounts pre-defined in the system
1. Customer: Username -> Guest, Password -> Guest, ID -> 0
2. Admin: Username -> Admin, Password -> Admin, ID -> 1

This system store all the accounts details in a local database so the accounts can be accessed any time once created. The passwords are also stored in a MD5 encryption.
